<h1>SURVIVING MODERNITY</h1>
<h2>The Comprehensive Everchanging Guide</h2>
<hr>

<h3>What is modernity?</h3>

    <p>Britannica defines <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/modernity">modernity</a> as "the self definition of a generation about its own 
        technological innovation, governance, and socioeconomics."

        For the purpose of this guide, "modernity" will encompass the political and social structure as it relates to what is deemed "high culture" 
        and what is considered "antiquated" or "inferior." </p>

       <p>While the Age of Reason stressed logic and understanding, this way of thinking was framed to benefit elites while associating rituals, dance, and customs with a "primative" culture.</p>
        
        <p>Sociologist Paul Gilroy references the term in his book, and views modernity as the antithesis of Black Atlantic, disporic culture. 
        Progressive in thought, the term shifts from enlightenment to oppression justified by structured reasoning and racism. 
    </p>

<h3>Why should you care?</h3>

    <p>
        Black Atlantic Religion is an amalgamation of West African religious practices, ceremony, dance, cuisine, and philosophical beliefs. All of this reflects the adaptive nature of diasporic peoples/groups--emphasizing survival, tradition, and resistance. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The antithesis of diasporic religion, modernity justified the oppression of enslaved West Africans; using reasoning to shape and structure West African descendants and their customs as inferior or “primitive.” The violence, appropriation, and stratification are direct results of this school of thought, shaping the values of modern society. While not inherently destructive, modernity elicited prejudice, discrimination, and placed those not in power in a category of “other.” 
    </p>

    <p>
        Modernity still threatens society by inhibiting progress, maintaining the status quo, and eradicating groups of people through stratification, oppression, and isolation. Surviving Modernity refers to any methods used to resist that oppression and establish a strong community of adaptive, fluid, and diverse thinkers. This also reshapes our preconceived notions of religion, ritual, and existence. 
    </p>


<h3>Now what?</h3>
<p>check out the "survival tactics" and consider using them to build a foundation of liberation, hopefully extending beyond our years.
