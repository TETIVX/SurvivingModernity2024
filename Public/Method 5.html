<h1>Take the Historical Approach</h1>

<h3>WTF is that?</h3>

    <p>Taking the historical approach involves deep anaysis using multiple sources of information. 
        This whole website was created using that approach. <br><br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_method">Here</a> is a better understanding of it. 
    </p>

<h4>This sums it up...</h4>

<p>Implementing the historical approach broadly describes the ways in which you research, gather information, and analyze the information; this form of research relies on perspective, which can change from day-to-day. To survive modernity means to analyze and evaluate on all levels; no historian, participant, or entity is bigger than the perception itself. Using this methodology requires a mutual respect of people, places, and events. This approach also maintains the dynamism of Black Atlantic Religion while contributing to academia and policy.
