<h1>Blend & Repeat</h1>
<h2>...then do it again!</h2>

<p>
    Always take the time to consider what youâ€™ve experienced, learned, and felt then find ways to constantly get this information from those in your community, or family. Go to different religious services, have dinner as much as you can with friends, attend events that they attend. Immerse yourself within the people [Community], blend ideas, take points you like, and make it your own. Nothing belongs to any one group or entity. Non-believers and believers alike can share a connection based on teaching, knowledge, respect, and discovery. Take the Creole route when there are doubts. <br><br>
    -No homogenous culture of anything; everything is a passed down blend of cultures<br>
	-Understand all religions and forms of practice<br>
    -It is okay to agree and disagree with forms of religion, but never keep yourself within one camp; that is how modernity strongarmed its way<br>
