<h1>Listen with your "3rd Ear"</h1>

<p>As you would look with your “3rd eye” do the same when listening. How we hear sound is just as important as the sound produced. <br>Ask yourself several questions when listening: <br>1) Who is producing the sound? <br>2) How do you feel about what you’ve heard? <br>3) Why do you feel that way? </p>

<p>
    -these questions serve as a guide for practicing non-judgmental listening <br>
	-respect differences in dialect, diction, and accent <br>
	-acknowledge your biases when listening to a person <br>
	-make sure listening is active, engage <br>
